Justice, in a legal sense, will never be complete.  The court of law cannot understand the depth of any given scenario
with enough precision to claim a perfect record.  This is no failure of our courts, but instead a shortcoming of humankind.
Perfect justice would require perfect information, a feat not yet surpassed.  To illustrate, to find a suspect not guilty
of murder on that grounds that he/she was never taught the wrongfullness of it would lead to chaos.  It isn't that such
information wouldn't be valuable, it's that we would not be capable of such detailed inquiry on each decision we make[^1].

Essentially, to be a perfect judge we need perfect information, something we will never have.  That doesn't stop of from
opining on others circumstances and actions with such authority, as if we know well the circumstances that brought them
here.  Far different from suggesting there is no good or evil, I suggest that whether someone meets that criteria is not
for us to say.  Such a title belongs to Someone much holier, Someone much kinder than I.
