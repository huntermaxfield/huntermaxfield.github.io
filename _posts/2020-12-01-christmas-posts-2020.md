The Savior is uniquely qualified to be our Master Teacher and Sheppard.  In "descending below all things", He was also
able to understand all things.  This includes the most important details of the human experience and the most trivial, 
the most sublime and the most dreary, the lightest and the darkest.  In laying ourselves at His feet, we give ourselves
the only chance for eventual relief from and solace in our temptations and deepest of trials.  That is not because He
was arbitrarily given this power, it is precisely because of His descension and subseqent ascension.  This event surely
lays claim on being the most historic for mankind, but also for our personal lives - if we allow it to be so.

"....it must be observed that this power of imagination is incapable of producing anything new." - Edmund Burke

Instead, Burke was of the  opinion that new ideas are simply the reoganization of past experiences and ideas as observed by the senses.
I see this in the condescension of Christ, which connected the two ideas of perfection and mortality.  By showing us a
more excellent way in the flesh, it gives us hope for how we begin to live to prepare us for a return home.  Along with His
Grace, it is His example of life that gives me hope that, one day, we will live in a state of never ending happiness.

Christ's greatest sacrifice was undisputably His Atonement, effectuated by his suffering, death, and resurrection.
In my eyes, a far second was His willingness to give of His time to others.  I'm not alone when I say that time
is invaluable - find me a biography of a highly influential individual that didn't emphasize
the hours and hours of work that came before their eventual fame.  In light of the ambition of our world, our Savior's
record of dining with loved ones, succoring the poor, and consoling the sick is well documented.  None more powerful had
come before him, none has come since, but yet his time wasn't spent in pursuit of profit, nor idlely.  No, our "Mighty God"
saw it most fit to be with people who loved him, and surely he loved them. 

In trying to give Him something that is valuable to me season, there is little I could propose that would eclipse my time.
Here's to a Christmas season that is spent serving Him with my time.
