title: "My Thoughts on Christ"

**December 22nd, 2020**

The impressions of the Spirit leave an indelible impact on the soul.  Though our spirituality is fluid as the tides, there are moments in life that we will remember as divine.  These moments end up being an anchor to souls, able to conquer the temptation or imperfections that poke at us all.  I marvel at *how* He can do this.  His perfect knowledge of us knows how the impression should be communicated and His perfect knowledge of the wondrous union of body and spirit makes sure that this impact will feel a way that is not of this world.  I have felt this in my life, more than just the "chills" or a spontaneous moment of gratitude (though I believe these stem from Him as well) I am speaking of a few times in my life when I have been so convinced by His existence that I'd willingly give my life on it.  The Spirit as His medium, our Savior can touch souls in a way that heals, perfects, and lasts.  

1 Now I, Moroni, after having made an end of abridging the account of the people of Jared, I had supposed not to have written more, but I have not as yet perished; and I make not myself known to the Lamanites lest they should destroy me.
2 For behold, their wars are exceedingly fierce among themselves; and because of their hatred they put to death every Nephite that will not deny the Christ.
3 And I, Moroni, will not deny the Christ; wherefore, I wander whithersoever I can for the safety of mine own life.

- Moroni 1:1-3

“I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.” - CS Lewis

There is a change of perspective when we choose to follow Him.  Written in our hearts, we can't help but to see new scenarios with a budding optimism or view the trials of life with prudence.  Truly accepting Christ doesn't just bring with it a change in behavior, but a change in thought.  A change in perspective.



**December 20th, 2020**

Christ gives unto us according to our desires, the scriptures give us no room to accept this as anything but fact.  But why?  

There are two reasons that come to mind, one for the better and the other for the worse.  For one, realizing that we have achieved what we once wished for is humbling.  Further, it brings us to our knees in gratitude (whether that be to God or not).  To wish for something, work for that, and achieve it is surely a manifestation of God's grace and everlasting love.  In a plan designed to have us get to know God, granting to us according to our desires is a sure fast way for us to see Him in a world where distractions are rampant.  With all goals that are achieved, there comes a moment of realization.  It seems as if its almost magic that certain things came together perfectly for us to reach the finish line.  Though hard work always has its part, we feel as though magic also played a role.  These moments are an unconscious recognition of something - Someone - much greater, Someone much better.  



**December 19th, 2020**

If our aim is comfortability, we won't maximize that by believing in Christ.  Much like a child in grade school isn't maximizing their ease of life by going to school, nor should a Christian expect this life to be easy for them, because it's not meant to be.  To take up our cross and follow Christ will likely bring ridicule in our life, daily reflection on things we need to change, and a sacrifice of doing that which we want for that which we need.  Many want the peace they see in believers, without doing the things (because they're uncomfortable) that seem to have brought that peace.  It cannot be so, or God would cease to be God. 

Believing in Christ may not always bring blessings in this life, but is in preparation for a world to come.  A world that, because we cannot imagine it, we do not know how to prepare on our own.  In submitting our agency to His will, we allow Him to mold us into someone who is ready to inherit an eternal peace for a period of discomfort.

Most kids go through a phase where school seems completely useless.  When priorities don't extend beyond teenage romance and the day's gossip, it's hard to appreciate the importance of the components that make up a cell or the pythagorean theorem.  At some point along the path of life, we inevitably wish for those days.  That we would have gotten better grades, paid better attention, and not talked (or texted, depending on your generation) through all of our classes.  Somehow, not instantaneously, our perspective changes and we see how valuable things were. 

Reading scriptures, kneeling to pray, and other religious activities can seem uncomfortable to those who aren't accustomed (and rightfully so!).  Praying over hamburgers and hotdogs isn't exactly intuitive, nor is reading from a book that is set thousands of years ago.  However, eventually a time comes when we care less about the comfortably of an activity and more about the results they produce.  Christ asks us to do certain things, because He knows best not because He thinks that we know best. 



**December 17th, 2020**

Christ ultimately asks us to make a decision in uncertainty.  He knows that all the facts aren't at our disposal, that His teachings are often at odds with whats trendy to believe, and that the past can seem convoluted.  It is in such uncertainty that our need for Him grows, a once kindled flame grows into a fire of desire to know Him.  I'm grateful for this uncertainty, because it allows me to actually *choose* Him, rather than just be *given* Him.  When I choose Him in uncertainty, because He knows exactly what that must be like, He can reward me with clarity in a language that I understand.



**December 16th, 2020**

Imagine yourself with your friends in a conversation about the talent of different players in professional baseball.  All nearly equals, a back-and-forth ensues with clear disagreement.  Since there is no real expert amongst you, the different opinions rarely will change anyone's mind.  Now, imagine Derek Jeter walks in and has a thought or two to contribute.  You'd be hard pressed to find a friend in the group that wouldn't keep his mouth shut and *submit* to Derek's opinions.  Any other route would be irrational.  

The reality of life is that there are some who are more wise (the choice between wise and intelligent here is an important distinction).  These experts are pivotal to society, whether they be teachers, doctors, laywers, or mechanics.  We listen to their advice nearly without second thought, which is nearly always in our best interest.  It is foolish, then, to let our lack of comprehension about God's ways prevent us from following them.  If we believe that He exists, we don't need to understand the intricacies of the Atonement of Christ to experience it heal us, nor do we need video footage of His resurrection to live with a strong hope that we will see deceased loved ones again.  

Our instinct to hold the standard of evidence higher for a belief in God is rooted in our fear of it being true so that we don't have to change, not rooted in some intellectual superiority as is often portrayed.  Indeed, if we simply went off those feelings that consume us when we follow His teachings we would fall to His feet in faith, regardless of how many verses we have memorized.  



**December 15th, 2020**

I remember well a conversation that my companion and I had with an individual while on my 2 year mission in Uruguay.  She and her husband considered themselves of the intellectual class, which to them meant the divinity of Christ was but a mere illusion, with no other option.  Their conclusion was that Christ was a good man who taught good things, but that He couldn't have been a savior, nor risen on the third day.  I now know this as a common argument, but it was the first time I had heard it.  I cannot remember what followed, but do remember wondering how someone could come to that conclusion, because that didn't seem a plausible option.  We must make no mistake, Christ claimed to be the Son of God, the very Messiah the Jews had been waiting for.  If He was not everything He said He was, then He would be a fraud.  He should be held accountable for leading His little band of followers down a path that led to torture and death.  He would be nothing short of the cunning cult leader that many ascribe to religion.  C.S. Lewis said it best,

"I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I have to accept the view that He was and is God."

The day will come and come soon where we must take a stance and decide who we believe Christ really was.  The two clear options that He presents us leaves fence sitting as an unfulfilling and nonsensical option.  As for me, I have chosen.  Through studying, pondering, and pray my mind has been made up.  I can no more deny Christ than I could the basic realities as life.  He is the Mighty God, the Prince of Peace, Savior, and Redeemer.

“In the contemplation of the miracles wrought by Christ, we must of necessity recognize the operation of a power transcending our present human understanding. In this field, science has not yet advanced far enough to analyze and explain. To deny the actuality of miracles on the ground that, because we cannot comprehend the means, the reported results are fictitious, is to arrogate to the human mind the attribute of omniscience, by implying that what man cannot comprehend cannot be, and that therefore he is able to comprehend all that is." - James Talmage

This insightful perspective eases this tension that has been between science and religion for centuries now.  Christ, far from being a Zeus-like figure perched on his heavenly throne with a lightning rod, is instead able to bring to pass miracles that are beyond our comprehension because His understanding of natural law surpasses ours without measure.  I believe Christ to be the ultimate champion of scientific endeavors, because the discovery of physical laws only brings us closer to understanding Him and His creations.  A person of God and science stands uniquely positioned to learn beyond the secular, because she can literally see the end (that God exists) from the beginning.  Such an assumption constrains the number of possibilities scientifically and sets us on our path.  I know that He lives.  I know that His ways are not my ways.  I also know that He has given us the faculties that, if we so desire, we can come to know Him in this life.  Those faculties are not limited to neither the spiritual or the intellectual,  but a beautiful combination of both.  Anyone who restricts themselves to only one method of investigation is inevitably leaving something on the table. 



**December 13th, 2020**

Christ listened.  He still does.  He has a track record of following a socratic like way of teaching, posing questions 
and then waiting for answers.  He isn't the bang at the pulpit type, nor the teacher who only likes to hear himself talk.
In a world where everyone wants to be heard, there is no one left to listen.  He's there though, waiting for us to realize
He's the type that gives no limits to your speaking time, responding with concise advice only.  He's the perfect therapist,
the patient friend, the wise grandfather.  The Light of Christ guides our intuition for how we *ought* to be, also 
giving us the blueprint for how Christ is.

While at the beginning, we may dominate the conversation, eventually our heart begins to yearn for what He has to say. Listen,
act, and come back ready for the next assignment.  In this iterative process, we will find that His advice isn't arbitrary.  He
is prudent, knowing exactly what we need in order to take the next step toward His type of life, even that eternal. 



**December 12th, 2020**

We are amazed at those who push their bodies beyond perceived physical limitations.  I think of Pete Kostelnick who ran
over 70 miles daily for 42 days or those who strain their bodies through excessive fasting and unique diets.  We are
amazed at these stories, and rightfully so.  On one side, it shows that we as a species are capable of so much more if only
we set our minds on it.  On the other side, more spiritually, it puts into perspective just how much suffering took place in Gethsemane. 

For the sake all that is good, all that brings light, all that is eternal, He subjected His sinless soul to anguish
beyond compare.  With the foresight only attributable to a literal God, He shall "suffered temptations, and pain of body,
hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death." His body was truly pushed to its limits,
beyond what we could ever comprehend, for us.  For no gain of His own, His body and soul went to the ends of possibility.

While typically awe is the emotion that overcomes me, today it is gratitude.  Gratitude for my Savior whose love extended the
realm of human suffering so that we didn't have to experience it ourselves.


**December 11th, 2020**

Making Christ a crucial part of our lives indicates action.  It is not something that happens by passive participation
in Church on Sundays or disengaged listening of a spiritual thought led by someone else.  Sure, those moments prompt us to
be different, but without the intentional action of dedicating our *desire* to Him, no relationship can be formed.  This
is one precise manifestation of "carnal security", where we get so caught of in the comfort of how things are that we lose
sight of what will be.  

Much like we make an active effort to improve in our profession, earn excellent grades, or get our body in good physical shape,
we must exert that same effort in trying to understand the things of God.  Given His goodness and expeditious response to our
pleas, I believe that the heavens could open in ways we never before imagined if we so desire it.  Lack of revelation in any form is not
because of His lack of power, but due to our lack of intention in seeking Him out. I speak of a dying need to know
Him as He knows us, love Him as He loves us, and return to Him as He wants for us.  I am sure He stands waiting, it is
only our apathy that stands in the way.



**December 10th, 2020**

There will come the day when "every knee shall bow and tongue confess before him ... that he is God."  I don't believe
that it will be done in anger, nor forced.  I believe all of us, believer and non-believer alike, will be in awe by His
grace and grandeur.  For us to be forced would break the law of choice, so instead I speculate that we will be
weak, falling to our knees and speechless.  In that moment, all that He has done for us will be clear.  The
entirety of the past will be before us, finally able to see that what we yearned for most He was always there to provide.

The difference between those who sought out Christ and those who denied Him will be their attitude as they kneel.  Some 
will regret time lost.  A life spent in pursuit for that which
brings happiness, only to realize that they looked where it could never be found.  Where they sought for comfort
in substance, instead they should have looked above.  With all of the opportunities that they were given at the forefront
of their mind, they must wonder why they didn't accept His hand just one of the many times it was extended.  

For me and those I love, I pray that regret never comes.  I pray that our knee's bend with humility and our confession
isn't our first realization at His reality.  I pray that this day will simply be the culmination of countless occasions
of micro-confessions, the daily decisions we have to choose that which is beautiful over that which is comfortable.  So, as
a start, I'll choose Christ today knowing full well that the momentum of this decision will lead to something marvelous. 



**December 9th, 2020**

The greater someone has assisted us in life, the greater responsibility we feel to not disappoint them.  For example, 
the disappointment of parents is a horrible feeling, many of us striving to live a life they exclusively would be proud of.
Today, I wonder why we don't feel that responsibility as acutely to our God. The words of King Benjamin ring so loudly,

"And now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are dependent for your lives and for all that ye have and are.."

No one has assisted us more.  I believe our God is in the details, one who Has been in each crucial moment to prompt and
remind.  Given that everything we have can be traced back to Him, our possessions, loved ones, and talents stand as a 
constant reminder that He above all deserves our desire to impress.  



**December 8th, 2020**

In any setting of leadership, there are some who govern by force and others who do so by example.  Some say, "I am in
charge, and as such.....".  This approach leads to those lack of respect and ultimate abandonment.  None of this
is novel, in fact its become leadership 101 ever since Maxwell released his "5 Principles of Leadership".  Even long
before then, though, we had been given an example that reigns supreme.

Life isn't easy.  The very goal of it is to change us, to mold us in to human beings that are far different than that of
the status quo.  Indeed, we have been asked to be kind when the world is rude, humble when most are prideful, patient
when most grow uneasy after mere seconds of stillness.  As a culmination of that, as if the bar wasn't high enough already
,we are asked to "Be ye therefore perfect".  However, we mustn't act as though Someone didn't come before
us and show us the way.  No - we aren't asked to live in a way that is far different than any of those who have *ever*
come before us.  On the contrary, while He held power beyond comprehension, He also yielded that very kindness, humility,
patience, and even perfection that we yearn for.  In a place where we will be led, either by choice or subconsciously,
I choose to be led by He who is in the trenches with me because He dug them himself. 

Jesus Christ stands alone in His ability to lead, because no one has suffered like he suffered.  That suffering brought
empathy, because He literally stood in our shoes, no matter where those shoes may be.  Most amazingly, He is not
selective in who He leads.  Regardless of our past, nationality, gender, or social status the invitation is the same:
Come, Follow Me.



**December 7th, 2020**

Jesus was "despised and rejected of men".  The Creator of Heaven and Earth, Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God - yet they
"esteemed Him not".  Surely, never in human history and has someone deserved more praise, but instead received vitriol
and betrayal.  Even greater than calming the sea, our Savior has always managed to love those who loved him not, extend
his hand where it had been numerously rejected, and show immediate mercy after years of denial. 

His composure and compassion amaze me.  How can someone so hated love so dearly? Yet, there He stands, our ultimate example
of His commandment to love your enemies, bless those that curse you, and pray for those that despitefully use you.  Let 
God be praised for this Gift, His Son, who not only gives us an example of how to live but also provides the power by 
which we can do so. 



**December 6th, 2020**

Some may think it'd be easier if God was granted unrestricted access on judgement.  Meaning, instead of having laws that
dictate our eternal progress, it would be more arbitrarily decided.  These would be those who wonder, "If i'm a good
person, won't God save me regardless of my willingness to keep certain commandments?" While enticing, it's much more
satisfying that God has instead given us a code of law that we can learn, study, and actively choose to live.  These 
are not arbitrarily laws, but instead they prepare us to live in a heavenly kingdom again. 

Given our imperfections, it is marvelous that a Savior was given to allow for mercy from these laws when we fall short. 
Together, His justice and mercy provide the confines needed to grow and become "even as He is." It is that life - He 
that provides opportunity after opportunity - that we celebrate during Christmas.  Is there another message more deserving
of our time?



**December 5th, 2020**

Terry Tao, a famous mathematician, broke mathematical understanding into three different phases: pre-rigorous, rigorous,
and post-rigorous.  Essentially, the first phase consists of memorizes formula's and plugging in values (which lasts through
the first couple years of college - most non-mathematicians never get out of this phase), the second phase focuses on
more formal thinking (this is when problems turn into writing proofs - usually the last 3 or 4 semesters of an undergraduate
degree), which then transitions into a intuitive phase. 

I believe our relationship to Christ can progress in this way as well (not to say its the only way).  At first, commandments
may seem like rules that we rather blindly follow because we have faith in the promised blessings.  Next, we begin to
study the scriptures that give more detail into the importance of the human experience.  It is only through study that
we find ourselves to the second phase.  At this point, we can easily begin to get comfortable.  We know the common verses,
we listen to general conference, and offer "acceptable" answers in Sunday School. However, the third phase requires more
of us, even "offering our whole souls.. unto Him".  I believe this type of faith isn't manifest in eloquence of word, nor
a Hugh Nibley education.  I've seen it only in souls who are meek having overcome greed,  and humble having overcome pride.
To them, the promise is fulfilled that "when He shall appear, they will be like Him".

Like math, there is no phase that is beyond hope.  Christmas grants us that reminder to carry on in our quest to become
like Him, wherever we may find ourselves.    



**December 4th, 2020**

It seems the first step of conversion to Christ is a love and commitment for what He emobodies.  When the reading of the
beatitudes resonates, a desire for more significance lingers, and a general humility wonders.  For those of us who have
witnessed conversion first hand, I've noticed that rarely is it a deep intimacy with Christ, but rather an assurity that 
this path is the one that will fulfill the aching heart. This isn't a flaw of conversion, but simply "awakening and arousing
the faculties".  

When the Savior taught that Eternal Life was to know God the Father and His son Jesus Christ, though, I don't believe He
was simply asking for us to awaken and arouse our faculties. No, I cannot believe that the eventual goal of faith is simply
to love what He embodies.  Instead, He was asking us to come to know *Him*, intimately.  Perhaps in seeking to hear him, 
speak to Him, and draw near to Him, our eventual meeting with Him won't be an introduction but a reunion.



**December 3rd, 2020**

The Savior is uniquely qualified to be our Master Teacher and Sheppard.  In "descending below all things", He was also
able to understand all things.  This includes the most important details of the human experience and the most trivial, 
the most sublime and the most dreary, the lightest and the darkest.  In laying ourselves at His feet, we give ourselves
the only chance for eventual relief from and solace in our temptations and deepest of trials.  That is not because He
was arbitrarily given this power, it is precisely because of His descension and subseqent ascension.  This event surely
lays claim on being the most historic for mankind, but also for our personal lives - if we allow it to be so.



**December 2nd, 2020**

"....it must be observed that this power of imagination is incapable of producing anything new." - Edmund Burke

Instead, Burke was of the  opinion that new ideas are simply the reoganization of past experiences and ideas as observed by the senses.
I see this in the condescension of Christ, which connected the two ideas of perfection and mortality.  By showing us a
more excellent way in the flesh, it gives us hope for how we begin to live to prepare us for a return home.  Along with His
Grace, it is His example of life that gives me hope that, one day, we will live in a state of never ending happiness.



**December 1st, 2020**

Christ's greatest sacrifice was undisputably His Atonement, effectuated by his suffering, death, and resurrection.
In my eyes, a far second (but absolutely stunning, none the less) was His willingness to give of His time to others.  I'm not alone when I say that time
is invaluable - find me a biography of a highly influential individual that didn't emphasize
the hours and hours of work that came before their eventual fame.  In light of the ambition of our world, our Savior's
record of dining with loved ones, succoring the poor, and consoling the sick is well documented.  None more powerful had
come before him, none has come since, but yet his time wasn't spent in pursuit of profit, nor idlely.  No, our "Mighty God"
saw it most fit to be with people who loved him, and surely he loved them. 

In trying to give Him something that is valuable to me season, there is little I could propose that would eclipse my time.
Here's to a Christmas season that is spent serving Him with my time.
