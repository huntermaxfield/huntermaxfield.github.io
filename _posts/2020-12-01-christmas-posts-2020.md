Jesus was "despised and rejected of men".  The Creator of Heaven and Earth, Wonderful, Counselor, the Mighty God - yet they
"esteemed Him not".  Surely, never in human history and has someone deserved more praise, but instead received vitriol
and betrayal.  Even greater than calming the sea, our Savior has always managed to love those who loved him not, extend
his hand where it had been numerously rejected, and show immediate mercy after years of denial. 

His composure and compassion amaze me.  How can someone so hated love so dearly? Yet, there He stands, our ultimate example
of His commandment to love your enemies, bless those that curse you, and pray for those that despitefully use you.  Let 
God be praised for this Gift, His Son, who not only gives us an example of how to live but also provides the power by 
which we can do so.

Some may think it'd be easier if God was granted unrestricted access on judgement.  Meaning, instead of having laws that
dictate our eternal progress, it would be more arbitrarily decided.  These would be those who wonder, "If i'm a good
person, won't God save me regardless of my willingness to keep certain commandments?" While enticing, it's much more
satisfying that God has instead given us a code of law that we can learn, study, and actively choose to live.  These 
are not arbitrarily laws, but instead they prepare us to live in a heavenly kingdom again. 

Given our imperfections, it is marvelous that a Savior was given to allow for mercy from these laws when we fall short. 
Together, His justice and mercy provide the confines needed to grow and become "even as He is." It is that life - He 
that provides opportunity after opportunity - that we celebrate during Christmas.  Is there another message more deserving
of our time?

Terry Tao, a famous mathematician, broke mathematical understanding into three different phases: pre-rigorours, rigorous,
and post-rigorous.  Essentially, the first phase consists of memorizes formula's and plugging in values (which lasts through
the first couple years of college - most non-mathematicians never get out of this phase), the second phase focuses on
more formal thinking (this is when problems turn into writing proofs - usually the last 3 or 4 semesters of an undergraduate
degree), which then transitions into a intuitive phase. 

I believe our relationship to Christ can progress in this way as well (not to say its the only way).  At first, commandments
may seem like rules that we rather blindly follow because we have faith in the promised blessings.  Next, we begin to
study the scriptures that give more detail into the importance of the human experience.  It is only through study that
we find ourselves to the second phase.  At this point, we can easily begin to get comfortable.  We know the common verses,
we listen to general conference, and offer "acceptable" answers in Sunday School. However, the third phase requires more
of us, even "offering our whole souls.. unto Him".  I believe this type of faith isn't manifest in eloquence of word, nor
a Hugh Nibley education.  I've seen it only in souls who are meek having overcome greed,  and humble having overcome pride.
To them, the promise is fulfilled that "when He shall appear, they will be like Him".

Like math, there is no phase that is beyond hope.  Christmas grants us that reminder to carry on in our quest to become
like Him, wherever we may find ourselves.

It seems the first step of conversion to Christ is a love and commitment for what He emobodies.  When the reading of the
beatitudes resonates, a desire for more significance lingers, and a general humility wonders.  For those of us who have
witnessed conversion first hand, I've noticed that rarely is it a deep intimacy with Christ, but rather an assurity that 
this path is the one that will fulfill the aching heart. This isn't a flaw of conversion, but simply "awakening and arousing
the faculties".  

When the Savior taught that Eternal Life was to know God the Father and His son Jesus Christ, though, I don't believe He
was simply asking for us to awaken and arouse our faculties. No, I cannot believe that the eventual goal of faith is simply
to love what He embodies.  Instead, He was asking us to come to know *Him*, intimately.  Perhaps in seeking to hear him, 
speak to Him, and draw near to Him, our eventual meeting with Him won't be an introduction but a reunion.

The Savior is uniquely qualified to be our Master Teacher and Sheppard.  In "descending below all things", He was also
able to understand all things.  This includes the most important details of the human experience and the most trivial, 
the most sublime and the most dreary, the lightest and the darkest.  In laying ourselves at His feet, we give ourselves
the only chance for eventual relief from and solace in our temptations and deepest of trials.  That is not because He
was arbitrarily given this power, it is precisely because of His descension and subseqent ascension.  This event surely
lays claim on being the most historic for mankind, but also for our personal lives - if we allow it to be so.

"....it must be observed that this power of imagination is incapable of producing anything new." - Edmund Burke

Instead, Burke was of the  opinion that new ideas are simply the reoganization of past experiences and ideas as observed by the senses.
I see this in the condescension of Christ, which connected the two ideas of perfection and mortality.  By showing us a
more excellent way in the flesh, it gives us hope for how we begin to live to prepare us for a return home.  Along with His
Grace, it is His example of life that gives me hope that, one day, we will live in a state of never ending happiness.

Christ's greatest sacrifice was undisputably His Atonement, effectuated by his suffering, death, and resurrection.
In my eyes, a far second (but absolutely stunning, none the less) was His willingness to give of His time to others.  I'm not alone when I say that time
is invaluable - find me a biography of a highly influential individual that didn't emphasize
the hours and hours of work that came before their eventual fame.  In light of the ambition of our world, our Savior's
record of dining with loved ones, succoring the poor, and consoling the sick is well documented.  None more powerful had
come before him, none has come since, but yet his time wasn't spent in pursuit of profit, nor idlely.  No, our "Mighty God"
saw it most fit to be with people who loved him, and surely he loved them. 

In trying to give Him something that is valuable to me season, there is little I could propose that would eclipse my time.
Here's to a Christmas season that is spent serving Him with my time.
