Christ's greatest sacrifice was undisputably His Atonement, effectuated by his suffering, death, and resurrection.
In my eyes, a far second was His willingness to give of His time to others.  I'm not alone when I say that time
is invaluable - find me a biography of a highly influential individual that didn't emphasize
the hours and hours of work that came before their eventual fame.  In light of the ambition of our world, our Savior's
record of dining with loved ones, succoring the poor, and consoling the sick is well documented.  None more powerful had
come before him, none has come since, but yet his time wasn't spent in pursuit of profit, nor idlely.  No, our "Might God"
saw it most fit to be with people who loved him, and surely he loved them. 

In trying to give Him something that is valuable to me season, there is little I could propose that would eclipse my time.
Here's to a Christmas season that is spent serving Him with my time.
